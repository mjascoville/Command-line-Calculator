# Overview

While I have a basic understanding of C#, I have never worked in C++ before this. I decided to use this program to help familiarize myself with C++ and its basics. 

I decided to write a simple command-line calculator to accomplish this. It can process a single line with one operator and two operands (example: 3 + 4). I wanted to keep the scope fairly simple, so I have avoided doing anything like order of operations in this program.

This program has only basic functionality, so I wouldn't expect it to replace anyone's calculator app they use. Rather, it was a chance to learn basic syntax of C++, and to see how it contrasts with C#.

# Development Environment

I developed this program in Eclipse, which is great for C and C++.

The program was written in C++, and I used the standard library. This was compiled with the GNU compiler toolchain. 

# Useful Websites

Here are two websites that I found useful in writing this program:

- [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [Intro to C++ (w3schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)

# Future Work

Here is a list of things I could do to iterate on this program in the future:

- Add the ability to process more than one operation in a line
- Implement an order of operations
- More operations (^,%, etc.)
